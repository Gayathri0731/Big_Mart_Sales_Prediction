# Big Mart Sales Prediction using XGBoost

### Overview

This project uses XGBoost to predict sales for Big Mart, a popular Indian retail chain. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can help Big Mart optimize its inventory and supply chain management.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Big Mart Sales dataset, which contains historical sales data for various products across different stores.

### Approach

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features from the data, including product categories, store locations, and seasonal trends.
3. Model Training: Trained an XGBoost regressor model using the preprocessed data and engineered features.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuned the model's hyperparameters using grid search to optimize its performance.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared.

### Results

The trained XGBoost model achieved a high level of accuracy, R-squared value of [insert R-squared value].

### Code

The code for this project is written in Python and uses the XGBoost library. The notebook contains all the necessary code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Requirements

- Python 
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Contributing
